# ASEN5218 Repo

This repo has all my code for ASEN 5218 Large Space Deployable Structures. The class really turned into a more math intensive course, thus all this code.

## Folder Organization

The code for this class has a certain organization. Each homework has a main script which facilitates running the code for the homework. That main script begins with an **x** so that is sits at the bottom of the file tree so its easily visible. All functions developed for the homework are stored in the same folder as the main scripts and labeled anything not starting with **x**.

## Running HW1

Easy, just run the script call *HW1_mainshell.m*
