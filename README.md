# ASEN5218 Repo

This repo has all my code for ASEN 5218 Large Space Deployable Structures. The class really turned into a more math intensive course, thus all this code.

## Running HW1

Easy, just run the script called *HW1_mainshell.m* in MATLAB.

## Running HW2

Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW2_mainshell.m*. There is also a Mathematica Notebook *HW2_derivations.nb* which has the derivations for Questions 1 & 2. These were done in Mathematica becuase MATLAB's symbolic functionality is actual garbage to look at.

## Running HW3
Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW3_mainshell.m*.

## Running HW4
Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW4_mainshell.m*. Make sure you also have the *save_fig_png.m* function available.

## Running HW5
Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW5_mainshell.m*. Make sure you also have the *save_fig_png.m* function available.

## Running HW6
Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW6_mainshell.m*. Make sure you also have the *save_fig_png.m* and *equilibrium_matrix.m* function available.
