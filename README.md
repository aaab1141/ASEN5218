# ASEN5218 Repo

This repo has all my code for ASEN 5218 Large Space Deployable Structures. The class really turned into a more math intensive course, thus all this code.

## Running HW1

Easy, just run the script called *HW1_mainshell.m* in MATLAB.

## Running HW2

Easy, just run the MATLAB script called *HW2_mainshell.m*. There is also a Mathematica Notebook *HW2_derivations.nb* which has the derivations for Questions 1 & 2. These were done in Mathematica becuase MATLAB's symbolic functionality is actual garbage to look at.
